# imgsorter
A python program for sorting jpgs, jpegs, and pngs into landscape, portrait, or square folders based on the file dimension ratios
If you have a folder of thousands of photos that you need to sort by their dimensions and move to separate folders, this will do so. If you have some that you want to sort into a wallpaper folder of images that are 16 by 9, this will create a folder within landscape and sort those first.
